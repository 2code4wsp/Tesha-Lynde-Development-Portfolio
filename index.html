        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Located in southern Oregon, as a entreprenuer, artist, and web developer with a passion to help others construct dreams into reality. 
                Nature has always had a pull in my life to grow, harvest, and forage which brought a small town Wyoming girl to the heart of the forest in the Pacific Northwest. 
                Aside from cultivating websites and raising a family, most of my time is spent in the great outdoors. Dedication and work ethic will reflect in projects I have previously 
                had the pleasure of working on as well as in the future.</p>
